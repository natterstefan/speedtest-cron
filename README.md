An easy to use script test the speed (down-, upload and ping) of your ISP regularly (cronjob). [Inspired (Forked) by J0s3f's speedtest_cron on gitgud.io][jsspcr].

## Idea

To run speedtests we use [speedtest-cli by Matt Martz][spcli]. For consistent results, always use the same test server. Regular tests can be used to identify trends.

The tests should be performed as close to the modem / router as possible. In any case I recommend you use a Ethernet (network) cable.

Ideal would be the execution directly on your router. If it has a storage for storing the measurement data and has enough power to run Python, you should run the code on the router. Otherwise I recommend to use a RaspberryPi or similar, which is connected by cable to the router.

## System Requirements

A UNIX-like system with Python (at least 2.5) is required to run the scripts.

### Submodule

If the folder `speedtest_cli` is empty run ```git submodule update --init```. It
should then checkout the commit with the hash `33e498beb30149ffe233b835cf1fcf012462d219`.

#### Troubleshooting

If the initialization fails (eg. because of the "`Permission denied (publickey).`"
error), you have to follow the proposed solution here [#1](https://github.com/natterstefan/speedtest-cron/issues/1#issuecomment-440756964).
Thank you [kyletaylored](https://github.com/kyletaylored) for reporting the issue.

## Installation

### speedtest_cron

With `./speedtest_cron` you run the test. But before you run the script you should change the speedtest server.

The current server is ```5351``` (*UPC (Vienna, Austria)*). You can get a list of available servers by running ```./speedtest_cli/speedtest_cli.py --list```. Replace the serverId with the one you would like to use. In order to find the best one, I suggest you run a speedtest on [speedtest.net](speedtest) first and use the server they use.

With ``` `/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'` ``` we get your current IP-Address and use it as the source for the speedtest. If you run into problems you can remove ```--source `/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'` ``` though.

### speedtest_crontab

_speedtest_cron_ should run regularly to be able to analyse trends. To do so you should add a cronjob to `/etc/crontab` or ```crontab -e```. Take a look at the _speedtest_crontab_ file and replace ```/path/to/this/folder/``` with the actual path.

### speedtest_csv

With ```./speedcsv > results.csv``` you generate a file of the generated results (one file per test in the speedtests folder). You can then further evaluate the results in a spreadsheet.

### speedtest_ifttt

After reading the "[Use Raspberry Pi to Measure Broadband Speeds to Hold Your ISP Accountable][iftttmaker]" article I decided to implemented [Aallan's work][gistaallan] here too. Because I would like to get either a push notification when the internet speed drops or add the result to a Google Spreadsheet automatically. This is how you use it:

- rename ```example.cfg``` to ```speedtest.cfg```
- setup the [maker channel on IFTTT][maker]
- add an Applet [like this one][ifapplet]
- add the secret key and event name to the `speedtest.cfg`
- run the script ```./speedtest_ifttt```

## Development

Improvements, suggestions or bug fixes are very welcome. Just create a pull request.

If you have updated the submodule (eg. different release/commit), update it with:

```bash
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git reset --hard'
```
